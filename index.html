                <p class="welcomePara">Thank you for agreeing to participate in this study. Please note that your participation is completely voluntary, and you can still choose to withdraw from the study at this point if you wish.<br>
                    This study will involve interacting with one chatbot, followed by filling out a short form about how you felt during that conversation. You will then interact with a second chatbot and complete the same form again, but this time based on the second interaction. Finally, you will be asked to answer a small number of questions on the study as a whole.<br>
                    Please be aware that this study explores emotional attachment towards AI chatbots. If this is something you may struggle with, please inform the person running the study, and we will withdraw you from the study. This is completely fine to do and we incourage this if you are concerned at all with the nature of the study.<br>
                    If you are happy to continue with the study, then please click the button below. Thank you</p>
